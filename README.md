# Project Overview
Website Link: [Baizonn Learning Center](http://18.136.43.88)

**Main Objective:**
Our primary goal for the Baizonn Learning Center website is to increase student enrollment by effectively showcasing the center's Math and Science education strengths, thereby attracting more parents and high-school students in Singapore.
To achieve this, we will create an engaging and informative design that ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly website. The design will be clean and modern, reflecting the professionalism and quality of Baizonn Learning Center.
We will highlight academic excellence by showcasing the center’s Math and Science education specialization. This will include featuring our academic partner, awards, and a sample of our teaching methods. 
We will present course information from the Primary to Junior College level. This section will include information on class schedules and fees, ensuring prospective students and their parents have all the information they need to make informed decisions about enrolling in the Baizonn Learning Center.

# Content Strategy
To ensure the successful deployment of our Baizonn Learning Center website, we will create an engaging and informative user experience through:
* Promotions and Deals: Regularly update the website with special offers, discounts, and promotional deals to attract new students and encourage enrollment. Highlight these promotions prominently on the homepage and through targeted marketing campaigns.
* Registration Forum: Implement an easy-to-use online registration form that allows parents and students to sign up for classes seamlessly. 
* Class Schedule with Filters: Provide a detailed class schedule with filters for different subjects, levels, and days. Making it easier for users to find and select the classes that best fit their needs and availability.
* Responsive Website: Ensure the website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience across all devices to ensure accessibility and usability for all users.
