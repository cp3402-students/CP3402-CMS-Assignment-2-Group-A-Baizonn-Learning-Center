Think about someone (perhaps the client) who already knows WordPress taking over the running of the site itself: how do they add new content – as a page or a post? In what category? You may have used a plugin for a calendar of events or something, which needs to be described. Do not recreate WordPress documentation, but clearly explain to the client’s site maintainer how this particular site is organised and can be updated.

# Schedule Table

**To add a new class schedule**, navigate to the Classes menu in the WordPress dashboard. Select Add new Class, title for the class should be the subject name, day and time, to be easily searched in the future. Fill in the details, subject name, class grade, start time, end time and class type, then publish the class.

**To add a new subject/class grade/class type option**, navigate to the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) menu in the WordPress dashboard. Select the Class Details field, select the field they want to change and add the value and label for the new option they want to add.

**To change class type colors**, navigate to the Theme Editor option in the Appearance menu at the WordPress dashboard, go to the function.php, find the display weekly schedule function and the in-line css is located below the populate class data portion.

**To change the filter selection**, navigate to the Theme Editor option in the Appearance menu at the WordPress dashboard, go to the function.php, find the display weekly schedule function and the filter section is located below the in-line css.
